Final design doc updated, with all the current functionalities and functions added. Favadder adder to functions and routes. Added comments to some functions in app.py that could help with clarification.

josephY -- 2019-12-03 00:10
Finishing touches, favorite mechanism working

wangD -- 2019-12-03 23:01
Formatted dashboard, added flag to US statistics page.

wangD -- 2019-12-03 9:24
Finished statistics for United States.

aliceN -- 2019-12-02 21:33
Added table that compares analysis by indicators. Replaced the lorem text in the welcome page with instructions on how to run ATMO.

josephY -- 2019-12-02 04:30
User must now provide keys in seperate files in the keys directory.

josephY -- 2019-12-01 15:10
Added Coal usage variable, app now has two independent and two dependent variables.

aNALYSIS bY iNDICATORS IS UP AND RUNNING. I am very tired, but I feel accomplished. As of right now, the
analysis by indicators option only has three variables to choose from, but more can be put into place.
All data is cached in a .json file called cache, and the cache is updated every time the server is started.

josephY -- 2019-11-28 18:40
Began caching ALL data into a cache,json file located in atmosphere/data/JSON. From here, the handler will pass data into the template, and the template will render the graph with the correct data points.

wangD -- 2019-11-27 9:26
Finished Census Bureau and EIA cards.

aliceN -- 2019-11-27 9:25
Updates to design doc:
  - Removed "most recently viewed" functionality
  - Updated component map to reflect currently used databases and APIs
  - Added documentation for analysis.html
  - Fixed documentation for base.html
  - Changed name of database "users" to "loginfo"

aliceN -- 2019-11-26 9:24
Updated design doc to reflect current file names and APIs in use. Made the slider
functionality optional and edited the scattergrams to only take in two variables and
have each point on the scattergram be specific to one state.

wangD -- 2019-11-26 8:56
Home page displays more statistics

josephY -- 2019-11-26 00:20
Template for analysis page, need to figure out how to pass data to the template in order to generate
the graph. As of right now, only the form works.

josephY -- 2019-11-25 10:15
Added boilerplate code for a scatterplot in the analysis section, using CanvasJS.

aliceN -- 2019-11-25
HOME STRETCH PLAN
  - Generate a scattergram that compares specified data from two states and displays data in table (Nov. 29, Joseph)
  - Complete the API cards (Nov. 27, David, Alice)
  - Complete the Home Page and what will be displayed upon user login (Nov. 29, David)
  - Cache API information into databases (Dec. 1, Moody)
If we are "finished":
  - Add user data specific functionality such as favorite states (Dec. 1)
  - Add tables along with the scattergrams that display numerical data (Dec. 1)
  - Add sliders that allow the users to move through time and view scattergram data through time (extra)

New variable: State GDP from the BEAAPI. Weird x4 thing because there is an entry in the dataset for every quarter,
rather than every year, but it seems to work. Flags API was messed up, fixed that as well.

josephY -- 2019-11-24 01:00
Succesfully implemented the U.S. Energy Information Administration API, as well as a nifty flags API. Lookup
by state now gives two statistics, Per Capita income, and Industrial carbon emissions, as well as an image of
the state flag of the state being looked up. Changes reflected in README.

aliceN -- 2019-11-22 09:26
Updated instructions, added hyperlinks to APIs, updated design doc

josephY -- 2019-11-21 23:50
Working implementation of BEA API, allowing the user to select a state to lookup per-
capita income from. Next steps are to incorporate a climate indicator, such as tons of CO2,
and generate a graph. Possible analysis tools: Correlation Coefficient, comparison accross states

wangD -- 2019-11-21 15:31
Welcome page displays welcome message and US population, flashes successful sign
in if user just signed in.

josephY -- 2019-11-21 10:30
DC was missing from states.csv, so I added it. Added drowpdown in lookup.

josephY -- 2019-11-21 09:30
Began making states API, programmes message flashing into templates for login and resigser. states.csv
needs to be incremented by 1!!!

moodyR -- 2019-11-21 09:04
Put some of the finishing touches on the login-registration

aliceN -- 2019-11-21 09:03
To make more awesome, we're going to write code as succint and easy to read
as possible because that allows others to read code and evaluate
them quickly and easily. Updating the design doc frequently to reflect new ideas
and changes allows others to be aware of changes made and adjust accordingly.

aliceN -- 2019-11-18 23:54
To the design doc, added: specific bootstrap features to implement,
explanation of how we store our data and how to access it,
made users database more compact, added roles, added functions.

aliceN -- 2019-11-18 06:14
Finished preliminary design document.

josephY -- 2019-11-14 21:35
Began working on implementing the UNSTATS API, running into an issue where
for most country codes, indicator 1.1.1 has blank "data." I don't know if this
is a problem with the API, my querystring, or something else. Indicator 1.1.1
for M49 code 1 (the World) works though, which is nice.
